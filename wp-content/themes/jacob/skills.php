            The crossover between design and programming has always been of interest to me, and since moving to London six
            years ago, I've been lucky enough to work alongside some talented teams on a number of high profile websites.
            I have a wide range of skills that include design (and working closely with designers), front-end development
            (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Responsive, UX), back-end development using open source technologies (PHP, Drupal,
            Django and Ruby on Rails), Linux server system administration, load balancing (Varnish and Memcached),
            deployment and performance tuning (Apache, MySQL and NGinx).
